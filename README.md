To run the Mars news scraping code, execute the following command:

python part_1_mars_news.py
This will output the titles and previews of the latest Mars news.

Web Scraping Mars Weather Data (Part 2)
The second part of the project focuses on scraping temperature data from the Mars Temperature Data website. It provides both the weather table and an analysis of key weather metrics.

Running the Code
To run the Mars weather scraping and analysis code, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python part_2_mars_weather.py
This will output the weather table and provide an analysis of average temperature and atmospheric pressure over different Martian months.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of web scraping techniques to gather Mars-related data and perform insightful analysis. It can serve as a foundation for further exploration and visualization of Martian weather patterns.
